<PropertyList>

	<!-- IAS -->
	
<!--
	Activate IAS Hold with pitch PID under the following conditions:
	1.	prop:/aircraft/afcs/ap-master -> value:true (bool)
	2.	prop:/aircraft/afcs/ver-mode -> value:ias (string)
	
	Input Property -> /aircraft/afcs/ias-setting
	
	Output Property -> /controls/flight/elevator
	
	NOTE: The IAS Hold may be a complicated concept here but actually, it's just holding speed with pitch, not throttle. I THINK the generic FG autopilot uses that, so you could probably take that an simply fine-tune it.
