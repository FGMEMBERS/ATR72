Rename the Aircraft folder to 'ATR72'

*** IMPORTANT NOTE! ***

The current development version works best for FG v2.11git/v2.12 but if you use FG v2.8 or v2.10, all you have to do is go to Downloads, click on Tags and download the respective tagged versions!

Or, if you're viewing this from bitbucket, use the links below:

Download ATR72 for FG v2.8 - https://bitbucket.org/muraleen/atr72-500-c-project/get/v2.8.zip 
Download ATR72 for FG v2.10 - https://bitbucket.org/muraleen/atr72-500-c-project/get/v2.10.zip
