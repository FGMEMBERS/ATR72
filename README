Rename the Aircraft folder to 'ATR72'

*** IMPORTANT NOTE! ***

The current version of the ATR72 requires the 'positioned' API in FlightGear (git 2.11, pulled after April 2013) to be able to run with full functionality. If you're using FG2.8 or 2.9git, please use the v2.8 tag from git.

If you find any issues, you can use our issue tracker here: https://bitbucket.org/muraleen/atr72-500-c-project/issues?status=new&status=open

If you need any help or support, please send an e-mail to muraleen@my.erau.edu
