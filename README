Rename the Aircraft folder to 'ATR72'

*** IMPORTANT NOTE! ***

We have incorporated a version check system to check your FG version and make the aircraft compatible for your version! Even though we have this, you are required to use this aircraft with FlightGear versions 2.8.0 or higher. The differences in systems are in 2.8.0/2.9.0/2.10.0 and the new 2.11.0/2.12.0 git version.
